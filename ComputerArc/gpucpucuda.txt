## CPU (i.e intel Core i5): Primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside the system. It carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output (I/O) operations. Essentially, the CPU is the "brain" of the computer, executing tasks and coordinating the activities of all other hardware components.

## GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) : is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images, videos, and graphics for display. Originally, GPUs were developed to handle graphics rendering for video games, movies, and visual applications. However, their ability to perform parallel processing (handling thousands of tasks simultaneously) has made them useful for a wide range of compute-intensive tasks beyond graphics.

	Graphics Card = GPU Chip + Essential Components
	Note: NVIDIA primarily designs GPU chips and related technologies but does not manufacture 	the physical chips itself.

	#CUDA : CUDA lets programmers use NVIDIA GPUs like powerful parallel processors to 		accelerate tasks like AI, deep learning, scientific simulations, and video 			processing. It helps to switch between GPU and CPU
