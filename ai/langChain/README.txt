## LangChain is a powerful framework designed for building applications powered by language models (like OpenAI's GPT models) that integrate with external data sources, 
manage chains of tasks, and enable more complex workflows. It simplifies the development of advanced natural language processing (NLP) applications by combining large language
models (LLMs) with custom logic and external integrations.

## Key Features of LangChain:
* Prompt Engineering: Simplifies the design and experimentation with prompts for interacting with LLMs.
--- Task Definition : summarization, translation, question answering
--- Designing the Prompt Template (could be dynamic) : Summarize the following text in 3 bullet points: {text}
--- Dynamic Population : {text}
--- Optimization : Testing Different Phrasing, Adding Examples (Few-Shot Learning)
--- Context Management : Managing the context of a conversation or a series of interactions.

* Chains: Enables you to link together multiple steps of interactions or operations, such as calling multiple LLMs or APIs in sequence.
--- Step 1: Parse the company name from the query.
--- Step 2: Check memory for existing company details.
--- Step 3: If funding or news is requested, trigger API tools.
--- Step 4: Format the final response.

* LLMs Integration: LangChain can integrate with various LLMs, including OpenAI's GPT models.
* Agents: Allows dynamic decision-making where a language model can determine which tool or API to use to solve a problem based on the context.
* Memory: Supports applications that require context persistence, allowing the LLM to remember past interactions or data.
* Integration with External Tools: LangChain can integrate with APIs, databases, and other systems to enrich the information provided by LLMs.
* Data Augmented Generation (DAG): Facilitates applications where LLMs need to fetch external information (e.g., from a knowledge base or search engine) before generating responses.
* Evaluation Tools: Offers mechanisms to evaluate the outputs of LLMs and fine-tune performance.
