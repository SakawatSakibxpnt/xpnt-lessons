## HTTPs VS SSH ##
******************

HTTP/HTTPS:
Purpose : HTTP/HTTPS is designed for web communication between a client (e.g., a browser) and a web server. It is primarily used to serve web pages, APIs, or other resources over the internet.
Use Case : Accessing websites, RESTful APIs, or downloading files from a web server.
Security : HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client and server using TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data.

SSH:
Purpose : SSH is designed for secure remote access to a server's command-line interface or file system. It allows users to log into a remote machine, execute commands, transfer files, and manage the server as if they were physically present at the machine.
Use Case : System administration, server management, file transfers, and running scripts or commands on a remote server.
Security : SSH encrypts all communication between the client and server, including authentication credentials, commands, and file transfers.


## SSH Tunneling: When you off public access of a server and create another route only for you.
